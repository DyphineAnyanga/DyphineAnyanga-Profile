###  About Me

I am a learner of the **ALX Software Engineering,AWS cloud computing and Data Science Program**, and I’m currently revamping my GitHub profile to stand out in my job search.

I began this journey in software engineering and data because **I believe in the power of technology to revolutionize healthcare**—from predictive models that inform care to dashboards that empower decision-making. My work is fueled by a desire to **improve health equity**, particularly in under-resourced communities.

 **My vision** is to make healthcare smarter, more accessible, and more equitable through **data-driven innovation**.

I’m interested in building:
- Health data dashboards
- EMR analysis tools
- Public health prediction models
- Patient-facing apps for health education
